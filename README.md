# Pine Script Indicators and Strategies

Welcome to my collection of Pine Script indicators and strategies! This repository is dedicated to providing traders and analysts with tools to enhance their trading decisions and chart analysis. Each indicator and strategy has been meticulously developed from scratch, focusing on usability, accuracy, and performance.

## Featured Indicators and Strategies

Below are the key indicators and strategies available in this repository:

### 1. Candlestick Counter

The Candlestick Counter is designed to count specific candlestick patterns within a defined range, helping traders to identify potential reversals or continuation signals.

### 2. Chart Pattern Detection

This tool automatically detects and highlights common chart patterns, making it easier for traders to spot significant formations like triangles, wedges, and head and shoulders patterns.

### 3. Trend Projection

Trend Projection uses historical price data to project potential future trends, assisting in making more informed decisions about entry and exit points.

### 4. Profit Plus Pro

Profit Plus Pro is an advanced trading strategy that combines several indicators to maximize profit potential while minimizing risk.

Custom Extended Trends allows traders to visualize and track extended trends beyond typical indicators, offering a deeper insight into long-term market directions.
